**Do not change the folder structure in this repo.** 

This repository contains a basic skeleton for a static website. 
``index.html`` will be the entry point and any stylesheets and images used will be contained in their
marked folders. There is a simple stylesheet, and a placeholder image to show the correct links.

``requirements.txt`` while not necessary for a website is included here to support cloning into Python
IDEs (Pycharm) so that the command:

    $ python -m http.server

can be used to start a local webserver and allow for the site to function as a network connected web site.

There is also a ``src`` directory that should be used for the programming in the first couple of weeks. You can create folders below this if you like. Note that this work will also require changes to the ``requirements.txt`` in the top directory.

The repository should be used from the start of the module to support your learning with the final 
commit point matching the requirements outlined in the assignment brief.

*Note: A ``.gitkeep`` file is the standard way to keep an empty directory in Git. You can safely ignore this file.*
